 * Name: stm32l4_pmstop
 *
 * Description:
 *   Enter STOP mode.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lpds - true: To further reduce power consumption in Stop mode, put the
 *          internal voltage regulator in low-power mode using the LPDS bit
 *          of the Power control register (PWR_CR).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero means that the STOP was successfully entered and the system has
 *   been re-awakened.  The internal voltage regulator is back to its
 *   original state.  Otherwise, STOP mode did not occur and a negated
 *   errno value is returned to indicate the cause of the failure.

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, this function will not return (STANDBY mode can only be
 *   terminated with a reset event).  Otherwise, STANDBY mode did not occur
 *   and a negated errno value is returned to indicate the cause of the
 *   failure.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: stm32l4_pmsleep
 *
 * Description:
 *   Enter SLEEP mode.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   sleeponexit - true:  SLEEPONEXIT bit is set when the WFI instruction is
 *                        executed, the MCU enters Sleep mode as soon as it
 *                        exits the lowest priority ISR.
 *               - false: SLEEPONEXIT bit is cleared, the MCU enters Sleep mode
 *                        as soon as WFI or WFE instruction is executed.
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero means that the STOP was successfully entered and the system has
 *   been re-awakened.  The internal volatage regulator is back to its
 *   original state.  Otherwise, STOP mode did not occur and a negated
 *   errno value is returned to indicate the cause of the failure.
